# 02-html-coderefactor
Hi, My name is Desta Mulualem I'm a student of Full stack flex coding bootcamp at Northwestern University. This is my first time home work  coderefactor.

 HTML,In HTML it was all page in div terms and I chenged to aproprite Semantic HTML5 to accessibilty for readers and easier maintainabilitiy. And I used header,navigetion (nav),section aside bar and div.

I use main for the main content of the body and under the main I use Section because it has more special meanings in  semantic HTMl5 for that I made section rather than div. aside bar is aproprete syntax for that rather than div

CSS it was scaterd in un apropret order and estended up to 200 I cleand up up to 167 I made which have the some properities and values in a group termes. 
 
 I used @media jqury for my header web page to be risiponsibility.
