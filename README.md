# 02-html-coderefactor
Hi, My name is Desta Mulualem I'm a student of Full stack flex coding bootcamp at Northwestern University. This is my first time home work  coderefactor.

 .HTML  In HTML it was all page in div terms and I chenged to appropriate Semantic HTML5 to accessibilty for readers and easier maintainabilitiy. And I used header,navigetion (nav),section asidebar and div.

I use main for the main content of the body and under the main I use Section because it has more special meanings in  semantic HTMl5 for that I made section rather than div. asidebar is appropriate syntax for that rather than div

    .CSS   it was scaterd in un appropriate order and extended up to 200 I cleand up up to 176 I made which have the some properities and values in a group termes. 
 
 I use @media queries for my header,nav ul, nav li, and for the body  web page to be responsibility.
